# Vanadium
Building, mining, and all those good things... but different somehow...
Vanadium is a survival blockgame developed on Unity (currently), by a small group of inexperienced developers. 
Perhaps it'll end up being a fun game. That's the hope.
Vanadium's Tech Demo (Version 0.0) is releasing this March, 2022.
